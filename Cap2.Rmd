## Abstract

Ecological communities are shaped by species interactions that vary over time and space. This spatio-temporal variability is fundamental for ecosystem functioning, allowing communities to respond to environmental stress. Here, we examine how variation in plant–pollinator communities influences plant reproductive success and its stability across two contrasting habitat types. Our results reveal high temporal turnover and shifts in species, their interactions and overall community structure. We find that stability in plant reproductive success was positively related to more variable community structures, suggesting that the dynamic reconfiguration of interactions sustains ecosystem functioning. Our work integrates macro-scale community metrics with reproductive outcomes, highlighting that shifting community structures provide greater resilience by creating ideal conditions for the reproduction of different plant species at different moments, leading to a stable community-level reproductive success. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and spatial scales to understand how biodiversity supports community resilience and ecosystem services.

## Introduction

Ecological interactions are central to understanding how species coexist and influence one another within ecosystems. Species interactions form non-random, structured patterns that are fundamental to unravel ecological dynamics, such as stability, species coexistence, and co-evolution [@burkle2013; @caradonna2017], with mutualistic relationships often exhibiting a nested architectural design that reveals the intricate connections between specialists and generalists [@bascompte2003; @bastolla2009; @guimarães2017; @rohr2014].

However, these patterns of species interactions are not static in nature, they vary depending on the abundance, phenology, morphology and/or the behaviour of interacting species [@vázquez2009; @stang2006; @maia2019; @peralta2020], all of which can change through time, leading to community structures that can also vary [@payrató-borràs2024]. Despite this dynamism, community ecology studies often aggregate data through time (e.g., days, weeks, years) into single community snapshot, which may include species that were not present simultaneously [@schwarz2020; @jordano2016], assuming a static community structure, and raising concerns about the accuracy of inferred species interactions and community dynamics [@yang2020].

To address these issues, recent studies have incorporated temporal and spatial perspectives into their study of species interactions [@peralta2020; @trøjelsgaard2016; @magrach2023], which are mainly driven by species turnover and/or interaction rewiring [@trøjelsgaard2015; @magrach2023; @poisot2012].

Understanding how species organise and interact in an ecosystem over time is crucial for comprehending the functioning and stability of natural communities [@thébault2010]. Community structure determines how each species contributes to the overall functioning of the ecosystem (e.g., interaction strength, niche differentiation) [@magrach2021, @duffy2007], which underscores the importance of studies that integrate both species richness and community structure to better understand the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem stability [@magrach2023; @lázaro2020].

Indeed, previous research has shown that there is a positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning both within single [@tilman2014] and multi-trophic communities (e.g., in plant-pollinator communities [@artamendi2024], driven primarily by complementary and/or selection effects [@wang2025]. However, within multi-trophic communities, other factors also come into play. For instance, research on plant species diversity and herbivore-predator dynamics shows that decreasing diversity can propagate through food webs, affecting predator diversities directly and indirectly through changing herbivore dynamics [@haddad2009]. These findings highlight the importance of considering community structure in multi-trophic systems [@poisot2013]. While community structure is known to influence ecosystem functioning in plant-pollinator communities [@magrach2021a], these relationships are often observed in aggregated communities, overlooking how temporal variability in structure may shift structure-function dynamics.

Here, we assess the impact of temporal and spatial variation in plant-pollinator community structure on plant reproductive success at community and population levels. We use data collected within two different biogeographical areas in Spain across two and three years respectively. Our aim is first to understand if micro-scale features of species (e.g., degree of generalization, specialization, weighted closeness) vary also across the different time scales. Second, we ask if macro-scale community features (e.g., nestedness, functional complementarity) change through time, both over short-term periods of time (weekly intervals) as well as large scale time periods (seasonally aggregated networks across multiple years). Third, we focus on understanding if adding information on selected interaction network structure indices to previously used simple visitation metrics (e.g., number and diversity of pollinator species) better explains the differences observed in reproductive success across different organizational scales, from populations to communities. Finally, we also explore the relationship between the stability in plant reproductive success and community structure dynamics.

We expect the communities and their structure to be highly dynamic, with different combinations of community structure benefiting different plant species at various times. Overall, we anticipate that communities with more variable structure will provide greater stability in plant reproductive success across time given that variation can facilitate species coexistence by reducing competition.

## Methodology

### Study areas

The study was conducted in Doñana National Park in SW Spain, and Gorbea Natural Park in the Basque Country in N Spain (Fig. S1). Doñana features a Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers and cool, humid winters. Annual precipitation is 500 mm, and mean temperatures during the study period range from 12.5 to 22.5ºC [@climaemet]. The surveys took place in fragmented woodlands dominated by stone pines (*Pinus pinea*), a habitat known for its diverse understory of flowering shrubs and annual plants [@aparicio2007]. The climate in Gorbea is heavily influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, characterised by mild winters and summers and high rainfall (\~1,300 mm per year). The average temperature during the study period ranged from 10 to 17.5 °C [@climaemet]. Beech forests dominate the area, interspersed with large conifer plantations, shrublands, grasslands, and scattered outcrops [@albizu2002].

We conducted field work during two (2020 and 2021) and three consecutive years (2020, 2021 and 2022) in Doñana and Gorbea respectively. Within each area, we selected five sites within similar elevations (50-150 m a.s.l. in of Doñana and 800- 900 m.a.s.l in Gorbea, Fig. S1), habitat and soil types, reducing potential confounding factors. The plant communities at different locations within each area were moderately similar, with a Sørensen beta-diversity of 0.317 ± 0.052 for Doñana and 0.345 ± 0.028 for Gorbea. The survey sites in Doñana were 3.2 to 24.2 km apart, while in Gorbea distances between sites ranged from 1.3 to 4.6 km. In Doñana, one site had to be replaced by a neighboring one in 2021 because it became inaccessible.

### Plant-pollinator interactions

Within each of the five sites at each of the two study areas, we established one 200m x 1 m permanent transect. Transects were visited every week if possible (sampling moments areas referred to from now on as periods), when weather conditions allowed, avoiding windy or rainy days. Within each site and period, transects were surveyed three times, for one hour each, one in the early morning (9.30-10.30), one in the middle of the day (13.30-14.30) and one at the end of the day (16.30-17.30), in order to obtain a complete picture of the community of plants and pollinators present throughout the day. During the whole flowering season (from February to May in the case of Doñana and from March to July in the case of Gorbea), we were able to sample each of the sites between 6 and 9 times depending on the year. Sampling was interrupted for two weeks in 2020 due to the lockdowns derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal was to sample each site weekly. Since we needed a full day to sample at each site, each sampling period lasted at least 5 days. Therefore, we defined "period" as the time interval required to complete a given sampling at all sites. This was however not always possible due to lockdowns, and bad weather, and therefore in a small number of occasions, a period covers a maximum of 10 days difference between the sampling of the first site and that of the last. During each sampling day, every flowering plant species present within the transect was identified, and all floral visitors that landed on the flowers and contacted the reproductive parts were recorded. Only floral visitors (from now on referred to as pollinators) that could not be identified in the field were captured, stored and identified in the laboratory by an expert entomologist (see acknowledgements). In addition, for each period, we recorded the number of flowers produced by each plant species present in the transect. A total of 474 hours of sampling effort were conducted over 172 days across both study areas and years, with 205 hours over 73 days in Doñana, and 269 hours over 99 days in Gorbea.

### Plant reproductive success

To obtain a measure of pollination function, we estimated the average number of fruits per flower (fruit set) and number of seeds per fruit in Doñana´s sites during 2021 and in Gorbea´s sites during 2021 and 2022. For this objective, we focused on the reproductive success of a subset of plant species in the community. Specifically, we focused on abundant species that are mostly self-incompatible, as well as easy to identify, collect and mark. In the case of Doñana, the selected subset includes six species of the Cistaceae family : *Cistus salviifolius* L. (Linneo)*, C. crispus* L.*, C. ladanifer* L.*, C. libanotis* L.*, Halimium halimifolium* (L.) Willk. *,* and *H. calcynum* (L.) K.Koch, as most woody species in this family are self-incompatible [@herrera1992]. In the case of Gorbea, we marked and obtained reproductive success data for the following plants throughout the flowering season of 2021 and 2022: *Cardamine pratensis* L.*, Erythronium dens-canis* L., *Erysimum gorbeanum* Polatschek*, Helianthemum nummularium* (L.) Mill, *Helleborus viridis* L. *subsp. occidentalis* (Reut.) Schiffn.*, Hepatica nobilis* Schreb*, Hippocrepis comosa* L.*, Hutchinsia alpina* (L.) R.Br, *Lathyrus linifolius* (Reichard) Bässler, *Lotus corniculatus* L.*,* *Pedicularis sylvatica* L.*, Primula elatior* (L.) Hill*, Primula veris* L.*, Scilla verna* Huds, and *Vicia pyrenaica* Pourr. For every plant individual, we marked open flowers and recorded the period in which those flowers were open and thus receptive to pollinator visitation. Fruit set for each species was calculated as the total number of fruits produced divided by the number of marked flowers. However, for certain species in Gorbea, such as *Helleborus viridis subsp. occidentalis*, which can produce multiple fruits per flower derived from an apocarpic gynoecium (up to a maximum of 5), we adjusted the fruit set calculation by dividing the total number of fruits by the maximum potential output (five).

### Data analyses

#### Sampling completeness

We evaluated the completeness of our sampling efforts using Chao 1 asymptotic species richness estimators [@chao2009; @chao2020] using iNEXT package [@iNEXT]. This analysis allowed us to estimate the cumulative richness of pollinators, plants, and plant–pollinator links as sampling effort increased toward full coverage. Data were analyzed at multiple levels: across years and study areas, as well as for individual sites and sampling periods.

#### Network analysis

We constructed quantitative plant–pollinator interaction networks for each combination of study area, site, and sampling period. We obtained 172 interaction networks representing pollinator visits to different plant species. From these, we extracted relevant network metrics at both the community and species levels. Due to the simplicity of some networks, we ultimately retained 153 networks with usable structural data.

**Population-level analysis**

At the plant population level we calculated a series of network metrics related to their position and roles in the network, as they are related to plant species fitness [@lázaro2020], including: degree, species specialization, weighted closeness centrality, and contribution to nestedness. The degree is the total number of distinct interactions a focal plant species has with different pollinator species. Specialization (*d’)* is independent of network size and measures the deviation of realized interaction frequencies from an expected probability distribution of interactions, based on the observed interaction frequencies [@blüthgen2006], and refers to how specialized a plant species is. Weighted closeness represents a centrality measure showing how close a species is to all other species in the network [@lázaro2020]. Weighted closeness takes into account not only the number of interactions of species but also their strength, meaning that species with many strong interactions with other species will have higher weighted closeness and therefore, a higher potential to impact the network´s dynamics [@opsahl2010]. We also calculated the contribution to a nested pattern of each plant species to detect key species that most influence network nestedness [@sebastián-gonzález2016]. Finally, we calculated the total visits per plant species performed in each network (sampling date).

**Community-level analysis**

At the community level, we focused on metrics that provide complementary information and that have been observed in previous studies to be related to plant reproductive success (e.g., Magrach et al 2021). Specifically, we focused on metrics that provide information on the complementarity in the functions performed by the different species in the community (e.g., functional complementarity [@devoto2012], as well as metrics that provide information on the redundancy in the roles of different species (e.g., nestedness), and that have been suggested to be more stable and resilient to perturbations and species extinctions [@petanidou2008]. In addition, we also obtained data on the total number of visits that are received by all the plants within a given community at a given time. We calculated both plant and pollinator functional complementarity using community-level measure defined as the total branch length of a dendogram based on qualitative differences in visitor assemblages between plants [@devoto2012]. In the case of nestedness, given that it has been observed to vary with network size and connectance [@song2017], we used a normalized value of the widely used nestedness metric NODF based on binary matrices, NODFc [@song2017]. This normalized value is calculated as NODF~c~ = NODF~n~ / (C \* log(S)), where C is connectance and S is network size, defined as the total number of nodes in the network. NODF~n~ is calculated as NODF/max(NODF), which is independent of network size and thus comparable across different networks [@song2017]. To calculate max(NODF) we used a corrected version of the algorithm [@simmons2019] whenever possible. All species and community-level network metrics were calculated using package bipartite [@bipartite-2] and the corresponding changes recommended by Song et al 2017 [@song2017].

### Statistical analysis

We performed all the analyses independently for both study areas (Doñana and Gorbea). Throughout all the analyses performed we first scaled all independent variables by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (SD). This transformation ensures that all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, allowing for the comparability of the model coefficients. In every case, the sampling sites (five sampling sites for each study area) were included as a random factor.

To assess whether pollinator and plant species richness values changed within and across years, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) (package *glmmTMB* [@glmmTMB] with a Poisson distribution. We compared two models: (1) a linear model with period and year as fixed effects, and (2) a model including a quadratic term for period, while maintaining year as a linear fixed effect. This comparison was performed for both plant and pollinator richness in both study areas to evaluate potential non-linear relationships. Model comparisons were conducted using likelihood ratio tests (Table S1).

To assess whether population metrics and community structure varied through time, we used GLMMs. For population metrics models, we used degree, specialization, weighted closeness, and contribution to nestedness as response variables. For community structure models, we used nestedness and functional complementarity for both plants and pollinators as response variables. The interaction between pollinator and plant richness with period and year were set as explanatory variables, as we expected variation in diversity throughout the season but consistency within years (Table S2-S3). For these models, we used Gaussian distribution due to the continuous nature of the response variables.

We evaluated the relationship between population-level metrics, community structure, and ecosystem function, defined by plant reproductive success, over time. This was assessed at both the community level (average reproductive success) and the population level (individual plant species reproductive success).

Before modeling, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) to check for variable correlation and conducted a collinearity check. At the population level, the degree showed moderate collinearity, so we removed it as an independent variable, as specialization also reflects the number of species links. At the community level, the total number of visits had a high VIF (\>3) due to its strong correlation with functional complementarity, so we ran parallel models, including either variable.

We first examined how population-level metrics influenced plant reproductive success, comparing three models: a null model, a random effect model with plant species ID, and a fixed effect model. Fruit set varied significantly by plant species ID (random effect model: χ² = 21.48, df = 1, p \< 0.0001; fixed effect model: χ² = 60.87, df = 17, p \< 0.0001). We then constructed four models with fixed effects, including pollinator species richness, plant species richness, plant species specialization, weighted closeness, total visits, and nestedness contribution, with interactions for sampling period and year. We tested different random effect combinations, and model comparison using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) showed no significant improvement with plant species ID as a random or fixed effect (ΔAIC \< 2). Therefore, we excluded plant species ID from the final model.

For fruit set, we used GLMMs with a beta-family distribution, while for seed set, we used a Gaussian distribution. We also checked community structure metrics affecting community-level reproductive success, fitting GLMMs similarly (Tables S4-S7). When analyzing seed number in Gorbea, we removed sampling site as a random effect due to its minimal contribution, leading to unstable coefficient estimates. Overall, the effects of variables on reproductive success at the community level followed the same trend across both models.

As seasonal variation in nestedness can facilitate species coexistence by reducing competition, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) of nestedness as a representation of nestedness variability for each sampling site in Gorbea for the years 2021 and 2022. Additionally, we calculated fruit set stability (1/CV) for the same years to ascertain whether nestedness variability influenced reproductive success stability. Moreover, temporal variations in pollinator functional complementarity can enable different plant species to capitalize on these fluctuations, thereby enhancing community-level plant reproductive success. To this end, we also calculated pollinator functional complementarity CV.

## Results

Our sampling effort spanned 474h of observation, during which we recorded 61 plant species in Doñana and 90 in Gorbea. In Doñana, 75.4% of the plant species received at least one pollinator visit, compared to 72.2% in Gorbea.

We documented 2,617 plant-pollinator interactions in Doñana, involving 144 pollinator species and 46 plant species (distributed across 879 interactions in 2020 and 1,738 in 2021). In Gorbea, we recorded 3,939 plant-pollinator interactions, involving 155 pollinator species and 65 plant species (with 1,690 interactions in 2020, 956 in 2021 and 1,293 in 2022, see Table S8 and Fig. S2). We registered 452 unique plant–pollinator combinations in Doñana and 646 in Gorbea, with low persistence across years (5.97% in Doñana; 17.34% in Gorbea), highlighting considerable temporal turnover.

In Doñana, plant species richness remained relatively consistent across sampling periods and years, while in Gorbea, plant richness increased significantly over the season (Fig. S2A, Table S1). Pollinator species richness followed similar trends in both study areas: reaching a peak towards the middle of the sampling period before declining. Notably, Doñana recorded higher pollinator richness in 2021 (107 species) compared to 2020 (72 species), whereas Gorbea maintained comparable values across its three sampling years (Fig. S2B, Table S1).

In Doñana, Hymenoptera dominated the pollinator assemblage (69.51%), with Apidae contributing 48.34% of interactions and *Apis mellifera* alone accounting for 41.77%. Other groups included Diptera (15.28%, with Syrphidae making up 10.39%), Coleoptera (13.34%), and Lepidoptera (1.75%). In contrast, Gorbea’s pollinator community was dominated by Diptera (63.03%), especially Syrphidae (52.75%), while Hymenoptera (29.93%) played a smaller role, dominated mainly by Apidae (19.01%). As opposed to Doñana, *Apis mellifera* here represented only 8.55%, while species in the genus *Bombus* made up 9.7% of the species. Coleoptera (3.7%) and Lepidoptera (3.17%) were the next most abundant pollinator orders.

Plant species displayed varying flowering phenologies, with some species blooming briefly at the beginning of the season and others flowering throughout the entire season (Fig. 1A). Similarly, pollinator species exhibited distinct temporal patterns, reflecting seasonal shifts in the composition and abundance of floral visitors (Fig. 1B).

### Sampling completeness

Our analyses revealed high sampling coverage for plants (88–95% in Doñana; 92–94% in Gorbea) and moderate-to-high coverage for pollinator species (77–81% in Doñana; 50–66% in Gorbea; Fig. S3-S5), while plant–pollinator link detection was lower (60% in Doñana; 44–53% in Gorbea: Fig. S3-S5).

### Species and Community-Level Structure Through Time

#### *Species-level structure*

Plant specialization exhibited different patterns in Doñana and Gorbea. In Doñana, specialization tended to increase through time (estimate=0.16, z=2.0, p=0.041; Fig. 2A and Table S2), a pattern that was consistent across sites and years (Fig. S10), while it remained relatively constant in Gorbea (Fig. 2B). In both regions, plant specialization was inversely related to plant species richness (Doñana: estimate = –2.0, z = –4.81, p \< 0.0001; Gorbea: estimate = –0.71, z = –4.3, p \< 0.0001). Interestingly, seasonal changes modulated this relationship, making it less negative (Doñana: estimate = 0.22, z = 2.3, p = 0.02; Gorbea: estimate = 0.08, z = 2.8, p \< 0.02) and highlighting that shifts in community composition through time influence interaction specialization. Additionally, in Doñana, areas with higher pollinator richness exhibited greater plant specialization (estimate = 0.59, z = 2.4, p = 0.016), though this effect diminished later in the season (period\*pollinator richness estimate = –0.11, z = –2.83, p \< 0.01). Plant degree, the number of pollinator species a plant interacts with, decreased with increasing plant species richness in both Doñana and Gorbea (Table S3), while no consistent temporal patterns were observed in either study area. In turn, plant weighted closeness, a measure of a plant's centrality within a plant-pollinator network, showed no consistent temporal trends in either Gorbea or Doñana (Fig. 2E-F), but was influenced by plant or pollinator richness respectively. In Gorbea, plant weighted closeness was negatively related to plant species richness (estimate=-0.61, z=-2.99, p=0.002), whereas in Doñana, pollinator species richness reduced plant weighted closeness (estimate=-0.59, z=-2.72, p\<0.01), with the effect being modulated by sampling period (estimate = 0.12, z = 3.28, p = 0.001). Plant species' contribution to nestedness, was positively related to plant species richness in Gorbea (estimate=0.46, z=2.45, p=0.01), although this relationship was also modulated by the sampling period (estimate=-0.065, z=-1.85, p=0.06, Fig. 2G-H).

```

#### *Community-level structure*

Across the sampling periods, distinct temporal patterns emerge in the structure of plant and pollinator communities in Doñana and Gorbea (Fig. 3A–D). In Doñana, nestedness was positively related to pollinator species richness (see Table S3), suggesting that greater pollinator diversity contributed to a more cohesive network structure. Regarding the functional complementarity of pollinators (Fig. 3C-D) and plants (Supplementary Fig. S14), similar temporal patterns were observed for both indices, with consistent oscillations across sampling years. In Gorbea, functional complementarity increased mid-season in all three years, whereas in Doñana, pollinator functional complementarity consistently declined throughout the flowering season (Fig. 3C). We also found significant interannual differences in Gorbea, with both pollinator and plant functional complementarity decreasing from 2020 to 2021 and to 2022. In Gorbea, both pollinator and plant functional complementarity were positively related to plant richness (Fig. 3D, Fig. S14), particularly around mid-season when pollinators and plants displayed more divergent trait combinations. Over time, this effect diminished significantly (Fig. 3D and Table S3), underscoring the importance of seasonal progression in shaping the functional roles of pollinators. Both study areas showed similar trends across all five sampling sites throughout the season (Supplementary Fig. S15-S17).

```

### **Population-level plant reproductive success**

We obtained a total of 863 records of fruit set for individual plants from both study areas, along with 2,211 measurements of seed number per fruit. At the population level in Doñana, none of the measured variables could explain differences in fruit set across plant species. In contrast, in Gorbea, fruit set per plant species was negatively related to plant species richness and to total visitation rates, while plant species with more redundant or overlapping interactions (higher closeness and nestedness contribution) experienced increased fruit set (see Table S4 and Fig. S18 A-D). Moreover, the impact of contribution to nestedness and total visits on fruit set were significantly modulated by the sampling period, though population-level reproductive success remained relatively constant throughout the season in both study areas (Table S4 and Fig. 4A and 4C).

For the subset of plant species for which we have data on their reproductive success for at least three different time periods, no differences in fruit set were observed between species identities, nor did sampling period affect fruit set differently among species. Additionally, no relationship was found between plant species richness and fruit set for this subset (Fig. S19).

```{r plots_splevel, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/F4.png")
```

In the case of seed numbers per fruit (seed set), the trends differed from those observed for fruit set. In Doñana, plant species richness had a positive effect on seed set, suggesting that diverse plant communities enhance reproductive outcomes. However, plants with higher degrees of specialization and showing greater contributions to nestedness were associated with reduced seed set—effects that diminished as the season advanced (Table S5, Fig. 4D-G). Moreover, the total number of received visits had an increasingly negative effect over time on seed set (estimate = -0.052, z = -2.03, p = 0.042; Fig. 4F). In Gorbea, we found a significant interaction between pollinator species richness and sampling period on seed set (estimate = 0.236, z value = 1.987, p = 0.047, Fig. 4G), indicating that the positive relationship between pollinator richness and seed number strengthened over time.

Seasonal trends on seed set diverged across both study areas. While in Gorbea seed set increased through time (estimate = 0.22, z = 1.84, p = 0.06) the opposite trend was observed in Doñana (estimate = -0.31, z = -8.4, p \< 0.0001, see Table S5 for full statistical details).

### Community-level reproductive success

At the community level, our analyses revealed that the influence of sampling period and species richness on reproductive success varied between study areas. In Doñana, the average number of seeds per fruit for the community of plants sampled declined as the season advanced (estimate=-0.23, z value= -3.34, p=0.001), accompanied by a slight decline in fruit set (Table S6-S7). In Gorbea, the overall reproductive performance remained relatively stable, although plant species richness showed a marginally negative effect on average seed set (Table S7). We also observed that the positive effect of receiving more visits on average fruit set decreased as the sampling period progressed (estimate = -0.54, z = -2.1, p = 0.038; Table S6).

### Stability in community-level reproductive success

In Gorbea, the stability in community-level fruit set was positively related to the variability in community structure metrics such as network nestedness (estimate=6.7, z=3, p=0.003) and pollinator functional complementarity (estimate=10.4, z=6.2, p\<0.0001; Fig 7A-B). A slight positive trend was also noted for pollinator species richness (estimate = 1.05, z = 1.65, p = 0.09), though no effect was observed for seed set.

## Discussion

This study provides critical insights into the complex interplay between temporal dynamics, community structure, and plant reproductive success Our results reveal that both interannual and intra‐seasonal fluctuations in species interactions, driven largely by pollinator turnover, have important implications for network stability and, ultimately, for plant reproductive success.

Across both study areas, we observed significant shifts in the pollinator community assemblage, while the plant community remained more stable. The high turnover, with only a small fraction of interactions persisting year-to-year, indicates that both communities are highly dynamic and likely adapting to environmental variability, including changes in climate, resource availability, or phenological shifts [@cirtwill2018; @caradonna2017; @alarcón2008 @caradonna2020; @olesen2008; @burkle2011].

In Doñana, plant richness remain relatively stable throughout the season, reflecting a less pronounced phenological gradient typical of Mediterranean systems. Conversely, Gorbea shows a marked increase in both plant and pollinator richness over time, consistent with its delayed and staggered flowering season caused by cooler climatic conditions at higher altitudes. These contrasting patterns suggest that local environmental conditions shape how plants interact with their pollinators over time [@sargent2008; @devoto2005].

The contrasting patterns in plant specialization between the two study areas suggest that different ecosystems may employ different strategies to cope with environmental variability. In Doñana, the observed increase in specialization over time indicates that more specialized interactions may emerge as an adaptive response to the increased competition among pollinators [@classen2020; @brosi2013], resulting from an increase in pollinator richness while plant richness remains constant. Conversely, in Gorbea, plant specialization remained relatively constant, suggesting that a more stable pollinator supply may help maintain generalized interactions. Furthermore, the observed negative correlation between plant richness and specialization suggests that higher plant species diversity fosters generalist strategies to mitigate competition for pollinator services [@maldonado2013; @denelle2020]. Moreover, the continuous oscillations in functional complementarity indicate that species are dynamically reconfiguring their roles—a rewiring process essential for optimizing resource use and ensuring effective pollination under shifting environmental conditions [@olesen2008].

The temporal evolution of network structure indices in our study reveals that plant-pollinator networks evolve not only through shifts in species composition but also through changes in their underlying structure over seasons. The positive influence of pollinator richness on nestedness at both study areas suggests that diverse pollinator communities contribute to more cohesive network structures. This finding supports the idea that biodiversity begets stability, with diverse pollinator communities acting as a buffer against environmental perturbations [@bascompte2003; @magrach2024]. Gorbea’s relatively stable specialization, combined with the positive effect of plant richness on functional complementarity, indicates that a diverse community can promote more complementary interactions. Moreover, the contribution of individual species to nestedness had a strong positive effect on fruit set in Gorbea, suggesting that species that integrate well into a nested network receive more consistent pollination services.

In Doñana, early-season reproductive success appears to be constrained by pollinator limitation, with total visits positively affecting seed set early in the season and suggesting that even minimal visitation can alleviate pollination deficits [@sánchez2017]. This aligns with the Mediterranean climate, where spring begins earlier, enabling plants to capitalize on the activity of a relatively small but effective pool of pollinators [@sánchez2017]. However, as the season progresses and pollinators become more abundant or shift to other co-flowering species, and plant richness does not increase, excessive visitation appears to lead to resource saturation or pollen wastage [@cayenneengel2003]. In this context, network metrics such as contribution to nestedness and weighted closeness—which might initially have neutral or slightly negative effects—become increasingly beneficial later in the season by ensuring high-quality, consistent pollinator services. Interestingly, while fruit set remains relatively stable, seed set is more sensitive to these temporal shifts, highlighting that the quality of pollination (rather than just the occurrence of fruit set) is critical for reproductive output [@memmott2007].

In Gorbea, the Atlantic montane environment experiences a delayed onset of spring, leading to early-season competition among flowering plants for limited pollinator services. As a consequence, high plant richness and total visits have a negative effect on fruit set. As the season progresses and pollinator abundance increases, higher pollinator richness positively influences seed set, indicating that a diverse pollinator community can offset early competitive pressures and enhance reproductive outcomes. Interestingly, contribution to nestedness appears to provide an early-season advantage by ensuring reliable pollinator visits when resources are scarce; however, this effect weakens later in the season when pollinator abundance increases. This means that the species with a high degree of nestedness is then less affected by the competition and suggesting that the benefits of network integration are most critical under conditions of scarcity [@saavedra2016].

At the community level, the average reproductive success reflects a composite of these varying individual-level responses. In Gorbea, the eventual positive effects of increased pollinator richness and effective network integration at the beginning of the season lead to overall robust fruit set and seed set, despite early-season competition. In contrast, in Doñana, the community-level dynamics show a decline in seed number per fruit and a slight decline in fruit set as the sampling period advances, reinforcing the notion that resource saturation and a decline in per-visit benefits occur as pollinator populations increase.

In Gorbea, the significant positive effect of nestedness variability and pollinator functional complementarity variability on fruit set stability provides strong evidence that a dynamically structured network can enhance ecosystem resilience by buffering against environmental fluctuations. This buffering effect is likely due to the ability of nested networks to allow substitute pollinators to compensate for periods of low availability, ensuring consistent pollination services even under adverse conditions [@bascompte2003]. This finding underscores the importance of maintaining network complexity to ensure the stability of ecosystem functions, particularly in the face of climate change and other environmental stressors [@bascompte2003]. The slight positive effect of pollinator species richness in fruit set stability also underscores the importance of conserving diversity for ecosystem functioning.

These findings carry important conservation implications. Effective conservation strategies should not only aim to preserve species richness but also maintain the dynamic processes that allow these networks to adapt and persist in a changing world. This includes promoting habitat heterogeneity, safeguarding key pollinator species, and implementing long-term, multi-scale monitoring programs that capture temporal shifts in network structure and function [@bascompte2003; @kaiser-bunbury2017]. Such approaches are particularly vital in the face of climate change and habitat alteration, which can disrupt the delicate balance of these systems.
